	Ping is a simple utility I made that you can use for pinging websites. 	<a href="https://github.com/SvGaming234/ping">GitHub link</a>  <br>

	<h1 id= "hsuhdr"><b>This website</b></h1>

	<h1 id= "hsuhdr"><b>Checksum</b></h1>
	<p>
	Checksum is my upcoming project. I already made it but i do not have access to the computer i made it on right now. <br>
	I will publish it on GitHub when I have access to the file. <br>
	Checksum is a utility written in Batch that can check file hashes in md5, sha256, sha1, etc. <br>
